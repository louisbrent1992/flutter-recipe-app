## Credits System

### How Credits Work

1. **Earning Credits:**
   - Purchase consumable credit packs
   - Purchase non-consumable bundles (one-time credits)
   - Subscribe to get monthly credit allocations

2. **Using Credits:**
   - **Recipe Import**: 1 credit per import
   - **Recipe Generation**: 1 credit per generation
   - Premium users bypass credit requirements

3. **Credit Storage:**
   - Stored in Firestore: `users/{userId}/credits/balance`
   - Tracks current balance and total lifetime credits
   - Transaction history logged for auditing

## Purchase Flow

### 1. Product Discovery
```dart
// Products are loaded on subscription provider initialization
final products = subscriptionProvider.products;
final consumables = subscriptionProvider.consumables;
final nonConsumables = subscriptionProvider.nonConsumables;
final subscriptions = subscriptionProvider.subscriptions;
```

### 2. Making a Purchase
```dart
await subscriptionProvider.purchase(product);
```

### 3. Purchase Verification
- Purchase details sent to Firestore
- Credits automatically added to user account
- Premium status updated if applicable
- Subscription status tracked

### 4. Restoring Purchases
```dart
await subscriptionProvider.restorePurchases();
```

## Integration Points

### Checking Credits Before Actions
```dart
// Check if user has enough credits
final hasCredits = await subscriptionProvider.hasEnoughCredits(
  CreditType.recipeGeneration, // or CreditType.recipeImport
);

if (!hasCredits && !subscriptionProvider.isPremium) {
  // Show insufficient credits dialog
  return;
}
```

### Using Credits
```dart
// Deduct credits after successful action
await subscriptionProvider.useCredits(
  CreditType.recipeGeneration,
  reason: 'AI recipe generation',
);
```

### Checking Premium Status
```dart
if (subscriptionProvider.isPremium) {
  // User has ad-free access
  // Bypass credit requirements
}
```

## UI Components

### Shop Screen (`/subscription`)
- **Credits Header**: Shows current import and generation credits
- **Subscriptions Tab**: Monthly and yearly plans
- **Bundles Tab**: One-time ad-free purchases
- **Credits Tab**: Consumable credit packs
- **Product Cards**: Show price, features, and "BEST VALUE" badges
- **Restore Button**: Restores previous purchases

### Insufficient Credits Dialog

- "Cancel" button to dismiss
- "Get Credits" button navigates to shop
